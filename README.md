# rick-roll
A simple batch script for rick-rolling

##FAQ

## How does it work?
The script first checks if the file is present in the widows startup folder.
If not it makes a copy of itsself in the startupfolder.
If the file is present in the startup folder it opens the well known YouTube video ;-)

## Can i convert the batch to a exe?
Yes you can via [this link](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/bat_to_exe_converter.html)
